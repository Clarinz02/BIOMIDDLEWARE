## 📡 New API Capabilities

### Multi-Device Management
```http
GET /api/devices                              # System overview
POST /api/devices                             # Add new device
GET /api/devices/{deviceId}                   # Device status
PUT /api/devices/{deviceId}                   # Update device config
DELETE /api/devices/{deviceId}                # Remove device
POST /api/devices/{deviceId}/connect          # Connect to device
POST /api/devices/{deviceId}/disconnect       # Disconnect from device
GET /api/devices/{deviceId}/test              # Test connectivity
```

### Device-Specific Operations
```http
GET /api/devices/{deviceId}/version           # Device info
GET /api/devices/{deviceId}/users             # Users on specific device
POST /api/devices/{deviceId}/enroll/face      # Enroll on specific device

```

### Legacy Compatibility
```http
GET /api/device/config                        # Still works (uses default device)
GET /api/users                               # Still works (uses default device)
GET /api/attendance                          # Still works (uses default device)
```
